Outlast Framework
=================

The open-source Outlast Framework combines client-side javascript with a model-view-controller server-side PHP interface that is a joy to use. It’s design allows a simple workflow for front- and backend development, turning chaotic code into a standardized work of art.

So what makes Outlast Framework special?
----------------------------------------
 - client- and server-side features abound: ajax, pushstate, and other HTML5 goodies are fun to use
 - modular design allows you to create (and/or use) plugins, extend, customize, and reuse them
 - a django-inspired template system with powerful template inheritance features
 - super-nice model and db api: never worry about multi-table joins or SQL syntax – unless of course you want to
 - connects to WordPress (via plugin), so blogging and CMS is built-in
 - heavily standardized, so once you know it, it’s predictable and logical, no matter who wrote the code
 - developed and supported by us (Outlast) while also being free and open-source
